Mule, the runtime engine of Anypoint Platform, is a lightweight Java-based enterprise service bus (ESB) and integration platform
The ESB can be deployed anywhere, can integrate and orchestrate events in real time or in batch, and has universal connectivity.
Mule has powerful capabilities that include:

    Service creation and hosting — expose and host reusable services, using the ESB as a lightweight service container
    Service mediation — shield services from message formats and protocols, separate business logic from messaging, and enable 
                        location-independent service calls Message routing — route, filter, aggregate, and re-sequence messages
                        based on content and rules
    Data transformation — exchange data across varying formats and transport protocols

Messages can be in any format from SOAP to binary image files. Mule does not force any design constraints on the architect, 
such as XML messaging or WSDL service contracts.

You can deploy Mule in a variety of topologies, not just ESB. Because it is lightweight and embeddable, 
Mule can dramatically decrease time to market and increases productivity for projects to provide secure, 
scalable applications that are adaptive to change and can scale up or down as needed.

Mule's stage event-driven architecture (SEDA) makes it highly scalable. 
A major airline processes over 10,000 business transactions per second with Mule while H&R Block 
uses 13,000 Mule servers to support their highly distributed environment.
